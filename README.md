# Num-Generator-C++
Interested in generators. Will be building more . better . excited.

The rand function generates a random integer, and std::cout is used to print the numbers to the console.
Note that the numbers generated by rand() are pseudo-random numbers.

Pseudo-random numbers are used in a variety of applications, including cryptography, simulations, and games.
